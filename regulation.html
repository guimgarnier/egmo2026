        <h2>EGMO 2025 in France: Regulations</h2>
        <h3>General Regulations</h3>
        <ol class="regulations">
          <li>
            <h4>General</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>The European Girls’ Mathematical Olympiad (EGMO) should if possible be held once per calendar year.
              </li>
              <li>The EGMO is governed by these General Regulations together with the Annual Regulations which specify
                details specific to each EGMO or required by national law. The Annual Regulations take precedence over
                the General Regulations.</li>
              <li>An EGMO takes place on dates and in a European country (the “Host Country”) specified in the Annual
                Regulations. The dates should be during the month of April.</li>
              <li>A “Host Organisation” specified in the Annual Regulations has overall responsibility for the
                organisation of an EGMO. The Host Organisation is responsible for ensuring that the arrangements for
                that EGMO support the aims of the EGMO and competition in the spirit of fair play. The Host Organisation
                may approve extensions of the deadlines specified in the Annual Regulations.</li>
              <li>The aim of the EGMO is to give more girls an opportunity to perform mathematically on an international
                stage, and so to discover, encourage and challenge mathematically gifted young women in all European
                countries.</li>
              <li>The EGMO Board consists of three to four elected members from European countries, one elected member
                from a non-European country, and three Host Country representatives, representing the immediate past,
                current and following Host Country. One of the three (or four) elected members from European countries
                is elected President of the Board. The Board is in charge of various matters arising. In particular, the
                EGMO Board makes recommendations to the Jury regarding future EGMOs and acts on behalf of the Jury in
                between EGMOs.</li>
              <li>The General Regulations may be amended, for future EGMOs, by resolution of the Jury or by the Board.
                In the latter case, the EGMO contact persons will be informed and the changes must be approved during
                the next EGMO.</li>
              <li>The Annual Regulations for an EGMO must be approved by the EGMO Board.</li>
              <li>The official language of the EGMO is English.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Participation</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>Participation in an EGMO is by invitation only. Each invited country is entitled, subject to available
                space, to send a team consisting of up to four contestants (the “Contestants”), a Leader, and a Deputy
                Leader, to be known collectively as the participants (the “Participants”). There are charges, specified
                in the Annual Regulations, for participation by teams from non-European countries that cover the
                expenses of the participation of such a team. An invitation to participate in an EGMO does not confer
                any form of political recognition by the EGMO, the EGMO Board or the Host Country. A Host Country may
                invite an additional team from that country to participate in an EGMO. Such an additional team has the
                same status as non-European guest teams. There may be teams consisting of Contestants from more than one
                country if none of these countries sends a regular team. The organisation for the national Mathematical
                Olympiad in at least one of these countries has to support the team. If all of these countries are
                European, then this team has the same status as an official European team. Otherwise, it has the same
                status as a non-European team.</li>

              <li>A country’s Contestants should normally be citizens or residents of that country, and should be
                selected through that country’s national Mathematical Olympiad or equivalent selection programme.
                Contestants must have been born less than twenty years before 1 April in the year of participation at
                the EGMO. Contestants must have been normally enrolled in full-time primary or secondary education on or
                after 1 December in the year prior to the EGMO, or, in the case of home-schooled students, must not have
                received a high-school diploma (or equivalent), and must be working toward such a credential on 1
                December.

                In special circumstances the EGMO Board can approve minor deviation from these rules for specific
                countries on request. Information on deviations must be available to other participating countries.</li>

              <li>Observers, including family members, (the “Observers”) may apply to accompany the Participants.
                Observers may be Observers A, accompanying the Leader, Observers B, accompanying the Deputy Leader, or
                Observers C, accompanying the contestants. The Annual Regulations specify whether Observers may attend a
                given EGMO, the charges for Observers and the deadlines for payment of such charges. Since extra
                accommodation is limited, no guarantee is given that applications to accompany the Participants will be
                successful. The Host Organisation should waive the charges for one Observer A and one Observer B from
                the Host Country for the following year’s EGMO.</li>

              <li>Contestants must be female. The Annual Regulations may require Observers C to be female. There are no
                restrictions on the gender of other Participants and Observers.</li>

              <li>The official programme (the “Official Programme”) as referred to below is the programme and outline
                itinerary for an EGMO and associated events. The Host Organisation reserves the right to amend or revise
                the Official Programme in whole or part. If it becomes necessary to make any significant changes,
                Participants and Observers of the invited countries must be notified. The Official Programme contains,
                among other things, details of accommodation arrangements (including food) for Participants and
                Observers and the venues for various official events associated with an EGMO. The detailed Official
                Programme may not be disclosed until arrival.</li>

              <li>Each invited country wishing to participate in an EGMO must confirm their participation in the way and
                by the date specified in the invitation. The registration of the team on www.egmo.org confirms that the
                Leader agrees to abide by the General Regulations and the Annual Regulations for that EGMO, and that the
                Leader is aware of the data protection (https://www.egmo.org/data-protection/). Participants, Observers
                and their travel details must be registered by dates specified in the Annual Regulations.</li>

              <li>Leaders and Deputy Leaders are responsible for the conduct of the Contestants, and for the avoidance
                of doubt the Leaders and Deputy Leaders are acting in loco parentis for their Contestants except where
                the Host Organisation has been notified in writing that an Observer has been nominated to act in loco
                parentis.</li>

              <li>Leaders and Deputy Leaders must ensure that their Contestants know and fully understand the Contest
                Regulations. They must also make it clear that any Contestant who violates any of these Regulations may
                be liable to disqualification from an EGMO.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Responsibility for Accommodation and expenses</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>The official arrival and departure sites are specified in the Annual Regulations.</li>

              <li>The Host Organisation covers all official expenses for Participants and Observers, including
                accommodation, meals, transport between the official arrival and departure sites and the accommodation
                sites, as well as other necessary transport between the accommodation sites and other venues on the
                Official Programme for all the Participants and Observers.</li>

              <li>Other than in respect of the provision of accommodation, meals and transport during the Official
                Programme as detailed in sub-clause 3.2, the Host Organisation is not liable under any circumstances for
                any costs or expenses whatsoever or howsoever incurred by any Participant or Observer in connection with
                an EGMO. In particular, the Host Organisation is not liable for any expenses derived from:

                spending extra days in the Host Country outside the period specified in the Annual Regulations;
                travel to and from the Host Country incurred by Participants or Observers;
                travel within the Host Country prior to arrival at the chosen official arrival site or following
                departure from the chosen official departure site incurred by Participants or Observers.</li>

              <li>All Participants and Observers are responsible for obtaining full accident, health and travel
                insurance if desired and the Host Organisation is not liable for any expenses arising from failure to
                obtain such insurance.</li>

              <li>The Host Organisation must offer opportunities to Participants and Observers for excursions and/or
                cultural trips but is under no obligation to organise specific activities.</li>

              <li>The Annual Regulations specify whether accommodation is in shared or single rooms. Where
                accommodation is in shared rooms, the Annual Regulations may permit application to be made for a single
                room, and specify the charges for accommodation in single rooms and the deadlines for payment of such
                charges. Since extra accommodation is limited, no guarantee is given that such applications will be
                successful.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Proposals for Problems</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>Each participating country other than the Host Country is invited to submit up to six proposed
                problems, with solutions, to be received by the Problem Selection Committee no later than the date
                specified in the Annual Regulations.</li>

              <li>The proposals should, as far as possible, cover various fields of pre-university mathematics and be
                of varying degrees of difficulty. They should be new and should be strictly confidential. In particular,
                they may not have been used in any other mathematics competition.</li>

              <li>The proposals and solutions must be written in English.</li>

              <li>The Problem Selection Committee selects the contest problems on the basis of the submitted proposals.
                The selected problems are presented to the Jury (see sub-clause 6.1) for translation before each paper.
                The Problem Selection Committee selects an alternative to each problem in case that problem proves to be
                already known when presented to the Jury.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Contest Regulations</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>The contest element of an EGMO (the “Contest”) takes place on two consecutive days specified in the
                Annual Regulations, under the direction of the Chief Invigilator appointed by the Host Organisation. On
                each day of the Contest the examination starts in the morning and lasts for four and a half hours. Each
                of
                the two examination papers consists of three problems.</li>

              <li>Each Contestant may receive the problems in one or two or three languages, previously requested
                during registration, provided that the Jury has approved the relevant translation.</li>

              <li>Each Contestant must work independently and submit solutions in her own language. The solutions must
                be written on answer forms provided by the Host Organisation. Contestants must write on only one side of
                each answer form.</li>

              <li>The only instruments permitted in the Contest are writing and drawing instruments, such as coloured
                pens, rulers, compasses and set squares without protractor markings. In particular, books, papers,
                tables,
                calculators, protractors, correction fluids, watches, computers and communication and any other
                electronic
                devices are not allowed into the examination room.</li>

              <li>The Jury, Observers and any others who have any knowledge of the problems and solutions before the
                examinations must do their utmost to ensure that no Contestant has any information, direct or indirect,
                about any proposed problem. They must also ensure that each day’s Contest problems and solutions are
                kept
                strictly confidential until after that day’s paper has finished. They are barred, between the
                presentation
                of the each day’s problems to the Jury and the conclusion of that paper, from participating in any
                mathematical coaching with Contestants, Deputy Leaders and Observers B and C. Similarly, Contestants,
                Deputy Leaders and Observers B and C are barred from participating in mathematical coaching with Leaders
                and Observers A during the same periods of time.</li>

              <li>The total number of prizes (first, second and third) must be approved by the Jury and should be
                approximately half the total number of Contestants. The numbers of first, second and third prizes should
                be approximately in the ratio 1:2:3. These calculations are made on the basis of the performances of
                members of official European teams. Prizes are awarded to participants from guest teams and any
                additional
                teams on the basis of these boundaries set by the Jury.</li>

              <li>Special prizes may be awarded for solutions considered outstanding by the Jury. Proposals for such
                special prizes are put forward by the Chief Coordinator appointed by the Host Organisation.</li>

              <li>The prizes are awarded at the Closing Ceremony. Each Contestant who has not received a first, second
                or third prize receives a Certificate of Honourable Mention if she has received seven points for the
                solution of at least one problem. </li>

              <li>Each Participant and Observer receives a Certificate of Participation.</li>

              <li>Participants and Observers consent to the publication of their names and, if provided, photographs
                on the EGMO website. Results may be anonymised and photographs removed on a request made by a Contestant
                at least two years after her final participation at the EGMO. Such a request must be made through the
                registered EGMO contact for that Contestant’s Country. </li>

            <h4>Jury Regulations</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>The “Jury” consists of all Leaders, together with a Chair. A Leader may be replaced by her/his Deputy
                Leader in an emergency (subject to the prior approval and consent of the Chair of the Jury). Observers
                A,
                members of the Problem Selection Committee and the Coordinators (as defined in clause 7 below) may also
                attend meetings of the Jury as observers. Observers are not entitled to speak or vote. However, they may
                exceptionally speak at the explicit request of the Chair of the Jury. Deputy Leaders and Observers B may
                attend, as observers, meetings of the Jury held after the Contest. </li>

              <li>Only Leaders of official European teams may vote in the decisions of the Jury and each such Leader
                has one vote. A motion is carried by a simple majority of those voting. In the event of a tie, the Jury
                Chair has a casting vote.</li>

              <li>The Jury may appoint sub-committees to consider specific matters. In particular, it appoints the
                Appeal Committee, consisting of seven Leaders, which should be speaking a wide variety of languages and
                of
                which one should be member of the Board. (See sub-clause 7.5.) </li>

              <li>The meetings of the Jury are conducted principally in English. </li>

              <li>On or before each day of the Contest the Jury approves the Contest problems selected by the Problem
                Selection Committee, or alternative problems if a problem proves to be already known, and approves the
                translations of the Contest problems into all required languages (including the final English version).
              </li>

              <li>The Jury approves the marking schemes for each problem. Initial proposals for marking schemes are
                prepared under the direction of the Chief Coordinator.</li>

              <li>On each day of the Contest, the Jury considers written questions raised by Contestants during the
                first half hour of the Contest and decides on replies. </li>

              <li>After the Contest, the Jury
                receives and approves a report made by the Chief Invigilator on the conduct of the examinations;
                receives a report from the Appeal Committee on any unresolved disputes which may have arisen during
                coordination (as in sub-clause 7.5);
                approves the scores of all Contestants;
                decides winners of first, second and third prizes;
                considers and makes decisions on all proposals to award special prizes;
                considers matters raised about future EGMOs. </li>

              <li>Any allegation or suspicion of a violation of the Regulations generally must be reported to the Chair
                of the Jury. If she/he considers there is a prima facie case, she/he must form a committee to
                investigate
                further. The committee must report its findings to the Jury. The Jury must decide whether a violation
                has
                occurred and, if it decides that one has, then it must decide what sanction, if any, to apply. Possible
                sanctions include the disqualification of an individual Contestant or an entire team from the
                competition.
                The decision of the Jury is final. </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Coordination</h4>
            <ol>
              <li> Coordination is the process where the official scores of each Contestant are determined in a
                homogeneous, fair and transparent manner. Leaders of each country must submit the papers of their
                Contestants to a coordination group provided by the Host Organisation. The coordination group consists
                of
                a Chief Coordinator and, for each problem, a Problem Captain and a group of Coordinators for that
                problem. </li>

              <li>For each problem, each Contestant receives an integer score out of a maximum of seven points.</li>

              <li>Prior to coordination, Contestants’ solutions are assessed by Leaders and Deputy Leaders, and,
                independently, by Coordinators, in accordance with the marking schemes approved by the Jury.</li>

              <li>Each coordination session involves two Coordinators provided by the Host Organisation and
                representatives of the relevant country. Two representatives, normally the Leader and Deputy Leader, are
                permitted to participate actively in any one session. With the approval of the Coordinators, one further
                representative may be present to observe the coordination process but cannot take any active part in it.
              </li>

              <li>The Leader (or Deputy Leader, if the Leader is not present) and the designated Coordinators should
                agree on the scores for each Contestant. These scores are recorded on official forms and signed by the
                Leader and one of the Coordinators. If the Leader and the Coordinators fail to agree on a score for a
                Contestant, the matter is first referred to the Problem Captain for that problem, provided by the Host
                Organisation. If there is still no agreement, the matter is referred to the Chief Coordinator. If the
                Leader and Chief Coordinator then fail to agree on a score, the Chief Coordinator reports the matter to
                the Appeal Committee. Both the Coordinators and the Leader write down their view in English, including
                the
                suggested mark. Additionally, the Leader provides an English translation of all relevant parts of the
                solution of the Contestant. The Appeal Committee then determines the final score. </li>

              <li>If, during a coordination session, the designated Coordinators consider that an irregularity may have
                occurred, they must immediately refer the matter to the Chief Coordinator. Unless she/he is satisfied
                that
                there is no case to answer, she/he must report the situation to the Chair of the Jury (see sub-clause
                6.9).</li>

              <li>For each problem, solutions by Contestants from the Host Country are coordinated by the Leader and
                Deputy Leader of the country that submitted the problem, with the assistance of the Coordinators for
                that
                problem. </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Entire Agreement and Understanding</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>The Participants and Observers acknowledge that these Regulations, and the documents referred to
                herein, constitute the full agreement and understanding of their parties and supersede any previous
                discussions or representations made by or on the behalf of the Host Organisation in respect of an EGMO.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Force Majeure</h4>
            <ol>
              <li>In these Regulations, “force majeure” means any cause preventing the Host Organisation from
                performing any or all of its obligations that arises from or is attributable to acts, events, omissions
                or
                accidents beyond the reasonable control of the party so prevented, including without limitation strikes,
                lock-outs or other industrial disputes (whether involving the workforce of the party so prevented or of
                any other party), act of God, war, riot, civil commotion, malicious damage, compliance with any law or
                governmental order, rule, regulation or direction, accident, breakdown of plant or machinery,
                earthquake,
                typhoon, fire, flood, storm, or default of suppliers or sub-contractors.</li>

              <li>If the Host Organisation is prevented from or delayed in performing any of its obligations to the
                Participants and Observers under these Regulations by force majeure, it has no liability in respect of
                the
                performance of those obligations affected by the force majeure events, both during the continuation of
                such events and for such time after they cease as is necessary for the Host Organisation to recommence
                its
                affected operations in order for it to perform its obligations.</li>
            </ol>
