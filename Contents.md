EGMO -> "About EGMO"
Titre -> "A 100% female international mathematics olympiad"
Paragraphe -> "The [European Girls' Mathematical Olympiad](egmo.org) is one of the most prestigious international mathematics competitions for high school students, and **the largest one dedicated to women**. First held in 2012 with 19 countries, EGMO has been such a success that it has become, by now, one of the most prestigious contests in the world for international mathematics, and the largest one dedicated to girls, with around

(liste à puces)
- 60 countries
- 250 contestants
- 500 people

Whereas the [International Mathematical Olympiad](imo-official.org) (IMO), which inspired the creation of EGMO, is still nowadays a very masculine event (10-15% of girls only), EGMO brilliantly demonstrates that women have certainly no less enthusiasm and talent for mathematics. Its aim is, thus, to encourage girls to pursue their passion for mathematics, through an opportunity to meet other young mathematicians from all over the world and to illustrate their talents on an international stage."

Titre -> "15th edition"

Paragraphe -> "EGMO 2026 will be hosted in Bordeaux, France, by [Animath](animath.fr) and the [University of Bordeaux](https://www.u-bordeaux.fr/), from Thursday, April 9th to Wednesday, April 15th. France has been an active participant in EGMO since 2013, but has only hosted in all its history one single international olympiad : IMO 1983, in Paris (32 delegations, just under 200 contestants). EGMO 2026 will therefore be the second, and by far the largest, international olympiad ever organized in our country; it will also be the first in over 40 years. We are all the more delighted to welcome this 15th edition in the beautiful seaside city of Bordeaux, and hope to make it an unforgettable experience for everyone.

# Information
## Venue & accomodation
Titre -> "About Bordeaux"
Sous-titre : 
Texte -> "Located on the Gironde estuary on the Atlantic coast, Bordeaux is a dynamic French metropole known for its pleasant lifestyle and for being the world’s capital of fine wines. It is also a rich historical site : the French Historical Monuments list more than 400 remarkable sites in Bordeaux (second most represented city after Paris) and a whole part of the center and harbor are acknowledged UNESCO World Heritage. Beyond the city walls, you will find unique natural landscapes, from the inland coutryside and the maritime Atlantic coast.​

Bordeaux is also a lively economic hub, home to many high-tech industries, as well as an academic and scientific one with more than 80 000 students and exceptional research facilities."

"Titre -> "Venue"
Sous-titre -> "Contest days"
Paraphraphe -> "Both contest sessions (Saturday and Sunday morning) will be on the modern [Campus Montesquieu](https://www.u-bordeaux.fr/campus/decouvrir-les-campus/campus-montesquieu) of the University of Bordeaux, a short bus ride away from the city center.

One of the major scientific and academic hubs within both French and European networks, the University of Bordeaux will be an essential partner in the organization of EGMO 2026, as well as the Mathematical Institute of Bordeaux and the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS).

These institutions are, as well as the whole French scientific community, very keen to encourage the promotion of mathematics for young people, and strive towards equal opportunities and a better representation of women in sciences. This is all the more necessary in the recent context, as we see with the high-school reform a drop from 44% to 17% in the proportion of girls following at least 12 hours of scientific subjects and 5.5 hours of mathematics per week in their final year of high school, while the challenges of today requires ever more scientific minds to create the world of tomorrow.

Titre -> "Accomodation"
Sous-titre -> "Hotels"
Paraphraphe -> "Contestants will be staying at the Hôtel Mercure Bordeaux - Château Chartrons (\star\star\star\star) in the elegant northern part of the city of Bordeaux. Jury member will join them for the last days of the week, after a short stay at the Hôtel Hilton Garden Inn - Bordeaux Centre. Both locations are easily accessible by public transport or on foot from the airport and the train station, and offer an ideal starting point for an relaxing walk in the city center or along the banks of the river Garonne."

## Travel information
### Coming to France from abroad
France is a member of the Shengen area. The [Shengen website](https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/france/visa/) provides all the necessary information to know whether you need a visa and how to apply for one (short duration stay "type C" visa).
### How to pack
- Currency (mettre un picto de monnaie ou un truc comme ça) The currency in France is Euro. Although change is still in use, payment cards and contactless payment are accepted almost everywhere.
- Climate : Bordeaux enjoys an oceanic, temperate climate thanks to the proximity of the Atlantic. Although reputedly sunny in the spring, it may experience occasional rainfalls or wind. Temperatures between 15 and 20 °C can be expected in the day.
### Travelling to Bordeaux
Bordeaux is one of the largest cities in France and its airport has connections fo a number of European destinations. However, most international flights land in Paris Charles-de-Gaulle airport. From there, the fastest and more Earth-friendly way to reach the city center in Bordeaux is to take a high-speed train (TGV) directly from the airport. Flight connections are also available.
Members of the local organization team will meet you at the Bordeaux Saint-Jean train station or the Bordeaux Mérignac airport, depending on your choice, on April 9th, and transport you back there on the day of departure on April 15th.

Bordeaux boasts an impressive record of around 400 national historical national monuments, only outranked in France by Paris. Its Port de la Lune ("[Port of the Moon](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1256/)") has been a major hub of trade and travel routes in Europe for 2000 years and entered the UNESCO World Heritage list in 2007.

# Organizers
 Titre -> "Animath"
 Sous-titre -> "The French association for competitive mathematics since 1998"
 Texte -> "Animath is the main association in France in the field of extracurricular and competitive mathematics. It was founded in 1998 to coordinate several "actions", each of them being a program of activities for middle- and high-school students, including the olympic preparation that would select and train the IMO team every year. In 25 years of existence, Animath has developped new successful actions, some of which are dedicated to girls such as the “Rendez-Vous des Jeunes Mathématiciennes et Informaticiennes", which brings together curious young female mathematicians, to help them get to know and inspire each other. More recently, Animath was co-founder of the international [ETEAM](https://eteam.tfjm.org/) tournament.

Meanwhile, the olympic preparation has become the [Préparation Olympique Française de Mathématiques](maths-olympiques.fr) (POFM), trains every year hundreds of students, who participate in half a dozen international competitions (including EGMO). The POFM provides not only contestants but also organizing board and jury members, thus has some experience of the organization of an international competition. Before organizing EGMO 2026, the POFM was at the initiative of the creation in 2020 of the OFM, the (remotely-held) French-speaking countries' Mathematical Olympiad, and its organizer multiple times.

The local organization of EGMO 2026 has now become an action of Animath in itself, with volunteers from the POFM and other actions to tackle the challenge.
